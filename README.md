# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nacho Eigu.

## ðŸ‘€ Passionate about Data Analysis, Data Science, and AI.

I'm an Argentinean living in Spain, and I'm 27 years old. As a Data Scientist with a high orientation in Python programming, I thrive on diving into data to extract insights and create meaningful solutions. Here's a glimpse of what drives my curiosity:

- ðŸ’¼ I'm deeply interested in **Business Intelligence**, **Data Analytics**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning**. These fields allow me to unravel the potential of data, making it a powerful tool to simplify the lives of individuals and organizations.

- ðŸŒ± I'm a perpetual learner, always in **sponge mode**, absorbing new knowledge and cutting-edge technologies. This ongoing learning journey helps me stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving world of data.
